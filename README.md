# CS-360-R1900-Summary of Requirements and Goals:
The Expense Tracker app was developed to help users efficiently manage their personal finances by keeping track of their income and expenses. The primary user needs addressed by this app were:

Expense Tracking: Users needed a way to record their daily expenses and categorize them.
Budget Management: Users needed to set and track their budgets to ensure they stayed within their financial goals.
Financial Insights: Users wanted to visualize their spending patterns and savings over time.
Screens and Features for User-Centered UI:
To address these user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app included the following screens and features:

Dashboard: A summary of the user's current financial situation, showing income, expenses, and savings.

Expense Entry: A screen to log daily expenses, categorize them, and add additional details.

Budget Management: A section where users could set monthly budgets for different expense categories.

Reports and Charts: Visual representations of spending patterns over time, with bar charts and data tables.

Notifications: Reminders for upcoming bills and expense tracking.

Our UI designs kept users in mind by maintaining simplicity and ease of use. We used a clean and intuitive layout, with clear navigation and straightforward data input. We also included data visualization elements to make it easy for users to understand their financial data. The designs were successful because they made it effortless for users to accomplish key tasks and gain insights into their finances.

Approach to Coding:
In coding the app, we followed a modular and organized structure. We used the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate concerns, making the codebase maintainable. We incorporated version control (Git) and established coding conventions for consistency.

The app was coded using a combination of Java and XML for Android development. We leveraged third-party libraries for chart generation and integrated features like notifications and data storage. The same approach could be applied in the future to ensure clean code, efficient development, and easy collaboration.

Testing and Importance:
Testing was crucial to ensure the app's functionality. We conducted both unit testing to check individual components and integration testing to confirm the proper interaction of features. We also performed user testing to gather feedback and validate the user experience.

This testing process is essential because it helps identify and fix issues early in development, ensuring a stable and user-friendly app. It revealed some usability concerns and helped us make necessary adjustments to improve the user experience.

Innovation and Challenges:
One challenge we faced was data synchronization and backup. To overcome this, we had to innovate by implementing cloud storage solutions and creating a data backup system to prevent data loss in case of device issues.

Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills:
I believe the component where we were particularly successful in demonstrating our knowledge, skills, and experience was in the data visualization and charting feature. We effectively implemented bar charts and reports that provided users with clear insights into their spending patterns and savings, which was a critical aspect of the app's functionality and user satisfaction. This demonstrated our ability to work with complex data and present it in a user-friendly manner, a valuable skill in mobile app development.
